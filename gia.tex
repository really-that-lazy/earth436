\section{Introduction}

 The Earths crust rests on top of the mantle, its elevation rising and falling
 with the amount of mass weighing on it. During glacial periods, a significant portion
 of the water on earth is transferred in form from water in the oceans to glacial ice sheets,
 weighing down the continental crust and causing the mantle to dynamically adjust
 with it. This causes the crust to ride relatively lower in elevation,
 a change which reverses when the weight is removed as the ice sheets melt.
 This vertical motion of the crust while attempting to return to its previous position is known
 as glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) (Scott et al, 2010). During the most recent
 half of the Quaternary period, the Great Lakes experienced at least six cycles 
 of glacial ice advancing to cover the Great Lakes basin before retreating northwards. Each
 cycle of ice accumulating caused the ground surface to depress under the added 
 load, as well as damming existing outlets with ice, causing the formation
 of new glacial lakes (Larson \& Schaetzl, 2001).\\
 
 The process of GIA has implications for the routes that the flow
 of water on the Earths surface takes as well. The "tilting" of the ground surface caused by 
 uneven rates of GIA in different locations (the thickness and residence time of
 the ice sheet impacts how much the crust subsides and how rapidly it rebounds) 
 may open or close drainage outlets from basins. This
 causes some rivers and lake outlets to go dry, while opening new outlets for 
 water to flow through as the 'tilt' of the lake basin changes and some locations
 rise and fall in elevation.
 Additionally, the change in "tilt" has potential to change shorelines of existing
 basins,  which has implications for land usage and long term engineering
 projections for structures such as locks and dams, where the lifetime of
 the structure may extend over decades or centuries. In the case of locks providing
 access to a canal, a local change in water level on the order of centimeters to
 meters over a century could cause the structure to become submerged below the
 rising water level, making the structure obsolete well within its intended usage
 lifetime.\\

 In order to project the future impact of this process on the Great Lakes Basin,
 the rate of GIA is estimated by comparing the elevation of the water level at
 two different locations around a common basin, and
 observing this difference over a long enough period of time to measure the long-term
 process of GIA. At minimum, 30 to 40 years of water gauge data are required to
 make an accurate measurement, or in this case, the much longer timescale of
 measurements available from the geological record.
 The most accurate measurement of the elevation of the water surface from the geological record
 has been measured inside ancient
 shorelines called beach ridges (Johnston et al, 2014)
 These beach deposits are preserved in embayments forming strandplain sequences.
 Their ages are measured by optically stimulated
 luminescence (OSL) dating of sediment cores from beach ridges close to where the
 elevations are measured. Elevation and age data for ?? number of beach ridges in
 four strandplain sites adjacent to Lake Superior are presented in Figure \ref{fig:rawData}.\\

\newpage 
 
 The data used for this paper was previously published in
 Johnston et al, 2012, being sampled from four separate locations around
  Lake Superior:
 Au Train Bay, Michigan (known in this paper as ATB), Grand Traverse Bay,
 Michigan (GTB), Batchawana Bay, Ontario (BATB), and 
 Tahquamenon Bay, Michigan (TAHB).\\
 \begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{Map of the Upper LGL with Lake Superior inset, showing locations of the modern Sault and Port Huron
	outlets as well as the ancient Chicago outlet which has since closed. Strandplains used
	in this study have been colour coded by study site using the colours blue (BATB), green (TAHB), purple (GTB), and red (ATB). Note that
	 the colour of each site marker will remain constant for that site throughout the rest of
	 this paper for clarity. Modified from Johnston et al, 2012}
	\label{fig:johnstonLaurentianMapWithSites}
 \end{figure}

 
 Observing Figure \ref{fig:johnstonLaurentianMapWithSites}, it can be seen that
 all four datasets follow somewhat
 linear trends, decreasing in elevation as the time before present approaches the
 current day. Johnston et al (2012) interprets this long-term pattern of relative
 water level change as GIA, with most of the shorter term variations being attributed
 to climate. The older shorelines studied in Johnston et al (2012) were observed
 to be rebounding further upwards over the last 5000 years when compared with
 younger shorelines around the basin. This creates an apparent lowering across
 the strandplain towards the modern Lake Superior shoreline, which is more pronounced
 in elevation for strandplains located in the Northeast than those to the Southwest
 of Lake Superiors shoreline.
 
 This is because the crust underlying the LGL has been rebounding upwards
 over the past 5000 years, which can be interpreted to imply that areas that were at the
 elevation of the water surface in the past have been shifted upwards in elevation
 above the current water surface elevation. The rate of this upward trend varies
 by site, generally increasing for sites closest to the north and east extremes
 of the range studied. This can be explained by the Northeasts closer proximity to 
 the ancient center of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which was located near current day
 James Bay in Northern Ontario.\\
 The data available from each strandplain recorded in Johnston et al (2012) varies
 by site. Between the four study sites, the most common feature is good data coverage between
 approximately 1000 and 3500 years before present at all sites, and a common gap in coverage around 2000
 years before present for 3 of the 4 sites. The gap in data is related to a 
 relative low water level period following Algoma highstand during a millenial lake level fluctuation
 (Johnston et al, 2014). While BATB has data
 coverage that extends back up to 5000 years before present, the other datasets do not, which makes relative GIA
 comparisons impossible over that time range.\\ 
 In order to measure a relative rate of GIA between sites, the rate at which these
 trends diverge must be measured. In the previous work of Johnston et al (2012) 
 using this dataset, GIA was calculated by subtracting linear regressions between
 study sites over the age range of each lake phase (such as Algoma, Nipissing, etc.). This was an
 effective first approximation for GIA, but failed to take into account that the unique nature
 of each dataset may not necessarily have been truly linear over each lake phase.
 Although these short-term variations may better relate to climatic variations,
 one must better compare these datasets to extract the most accurate rates of GIA.
  \\
 In order to better estimate GIA from ancient shorelines, a better method would be to simply subtract
 the differences in elevation between sites and plot these differences with
 respect to time, similar to the method of Mainville \& Craymer (2005), with
 water level gauge data. Unfortunately however, none of the datasets of Johnston
 et al (2012) have elevations
 measured at the exact same times. In other words, an estimate of elevation is needed for times where
 one dataset
 has a data point present, but the other does not have an elevation datapoint measured.
 The objective of the research presented in this paper is to develop a new method
 of calculating differences
 in elevation between data points and modelled data between sites for the
 strandplain paleohydrographs published in Johnston et al (2012). Calculated rates
 of GIA from this papers method will be compared to the results of previous GIA
 calculations constructed using geological data (Johnston et al, 2012) and
 historical data (Mainville \& Craymer, 2005). \\

 \section{Methods}
 The data used in this paper was collected by Johnston et al (2012), where elevations
 were measured in cores through beach ridges to record subsurface elevations
 representative of past lake level. Ages for each beach ridge cored were calculated
 using OSL ages collected across strandplains. To account for unequally spaced 
 elevation data between strandplains, this paper creates a modelled elevation for points where elevation was not directly
 measured by using linear interpolation between data points. This is
 represented as a solid line between points for each strandplain site
 as seen in Figure \ref{fig:rawDataWithModel}.
 Once this estimate of elevation for times between sampled datapoints at each site
 was created, the difference in elevation between sites were calculated by subtracting
 the elevation of a measured data point from the modelled elevation of another
 dataset at that point in time. An example of this difference is shown as a dashed line in
 Figure \ref{fig:rawDataWithModelZoomed}:
 \begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=1.1\linewidth]{data/theDataZoomed.png}
	\caption{Example GIA comparison between strandplain datasets. Comparison made from a data point to the linear interpolation
	model, represented by a vertical alternating dashed line}
	\label{fig:rawDataWithModelZoomed}
 \end{figure}
 Using comparisons from one study sites measured data points to another sites
 linear interpolation model,
 two graphs of the relative difference over time was created for each pair
 of sites. For example, for
 the site combination of ATB \& BATB, ATB was first compared to BATB, followed 
 by a comparison from BATB to ATB. The rates of GIA produced by these comparisons
 should be of opposite signs, but similar magnitudes.
 
 The GIA rates are determined by applying a linear regression to each comparison,
 the slope of each regression representing the relative rate of GIA between sites.
 
 To avoid making comparisons between data in one dataset and modelled elevation
 data for another site in areas where the linear interpolation model for a
 strandplain extends over long time periods between measured data
 (i.e. 1500 year gap in TAHB Figure \ref{fig:rawDataWithModel}), the data for all four sites was grouped into a series of bins.
 These bins started at 450 years before present with a width of 200 years for each bin.
 The start point was chosen by taking the youngest age value recorded in any of
 the datasets and rounding down to the nearest ten, in this case 450 years
 before present. The 200 year bin width or maximum acceptable age duration for
 comparisons between strandplains was chosen as it corresponds to the average error
 of the strandplain age models for shorelines published in Johnston et al (2012).
 If any bin had no data
 available for one site or the other when making elevation comparisons between
 strandplain sites, none of the data points in
 that bin range were used to make comparisons, thus ensuring that areas like the
 long gap in TAHB were not included when subtracting elevations to compute GIA.
 In addition, a second rule
 was created, stipulating that the site counts for any bin needed to be within
 75\% of one another to be considered
 in calculating relative elevation between sites. This
 helped identify a few areas where the datasets for both bins compared poorly,
 but produced valid comparison windows. An example is shown in figure \ref{fig:rawDataWithModel}
 where there is some overlap between sites GTB and TAHB between 650 and 850 years
 before present. Although both sites have at least one data point present within this
 window of time, the very low amount of data for site TAHB (1 data point vs 6 for
 GTB) calls into question the reliability of any comparison made between actual measurements
 and a linear interpolation model built off of very limited data.\\
 In order to implement the methods described above, which include subtracting
 measured and modelled elevations while filtering for gaps with insufficient
 data, a python script was written to analyze the data published by Johnston et
 al (2012). The source code for this thesis can be referenced in the Appendix.
