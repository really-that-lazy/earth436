\section{Introduction}
 The Earths crust rests on top of the mantle, its elevation rising and falling
 with the amount of mass weighing on it. During glacial periods, a significant portion
 of the water on earth is transferred in form from water in the oceans to glacial ice sheets,
 weighing down the continental crust and causing the mantle to dynamically adjust
 with it. This causes the crust to ride relatively lower in elevation,
 a change which reverses when the weight is removed as the ice sheets melt.
 This vertical motion of the crust while attempting to returning to its previous position is known
 as glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) (Scott et al, 2010).\\
 
 The process of GIA has implications for the routes that the flow
 of water on the Earths surface takes; the "tilting" of the surface caused by 
 uneven rates of GIA in different locations (the thickness and residence time of
 the ice sheet impacts how much the crust subsides and how rapidly it rebounds) 
 may open or close drainage outlets from basins, possibly
 causing some rivers and lake outlets to go dry, while opening new ones as the
 'tilt' of the lake basin changes.
 Additionally, the change in "tilt" has potential to change shorelines of existing
 basins, which has implications for land usage and long term engineering
 projections for structures such as locks and dams, where the usage lifetime of
 the structure may extend over decades or centuries.\\

 In order to project the future impact of this process on the Great Lakes Basin,
 an estimate of the historical rate of GIA is needed. This estimate is obtained by
 comparing the elevation of the water mark at two different locations around a basin, and
 observing how this difference changes over time. The elevation of the water can be inferred
 by a variety of indicators in the sediment record, in this case, beach deposits known
 as strandplain sequences are used, their ages determined by optically stimulated
 luminescence (OSL) dating. This raw data is presented in Figure \ref{fig:rawData}.\\
\include{rawDataGraph}

\newpage 
 
 The data was sampled from four separate locations around Lake Superior, namely
 Au Train Bay, Michigan (known in this paper as ATB), Grand Traverse Bay,
 Michigan (known as GTB), Batchawana Bay, Ontario (known as BATB), and 
 Tahquamenon Bay, Michigan (TAHB).\\

	\label{fig:johnstonLaurentianMapWithSites}
 \end{figure}

 These datasets were previously created by
 Johnston et al, 2014, but were analyzed using a different method.
 From observing the graph, it can be seen that all four datasets follow somewhat
 linear trends, increasing in elevation as the time before present increases.
 This is because the crust underlying the Great Lakes has been rebounding upwards
 over the time period in question, implying that areas that were at the
 elevation of the water surface in the past have been shifted up in elevation
 above the current water surface elevation. The rate of this upward trend varies
 by site, generally increasing for sites closest to the north and east extremes.
 (this is due to the rate of rebound increasing with closeness to the center of
 the Laurentide Ice Sheet, roughly near current day James Bay in Northern Ontario).\\
 Between the four sites, the most common feature is good data coverage between
 1000 and 3500 years before present, with a common gap in coverage around 2000
 years before present. This was due to conditions which worked against the
 formation of strandplain sequences during the Algoma lake level fluctuation
 (Johnston et al, 2014), thus causing most of our datasets to have interrupted
 records of lake level elevation at this time. While some of the datasets have
 coverage extending far beyond this range, the only dataset which does not follow
 this pattern of data coverage is TAHB, which will be discussed later in this section.\\ 
 In order to measure a relative rate of GIA between sites, the rate at which these
 trends diverge must be measured. In the previous work done on this dataset, this
 was accomplished by representing the trend of increasing elevation with age as
 a straight line using a linear regression (Johnston et al, 2014). This was an
 effective first approximation, but failed to take into account that large gaps
 exist the ranges of time before present where no data is available for some
 sites. For example, the TAHB dataset has a large gap between 600 and 2100 years
 before present in which no data is available. A linear regression of this dataset
 would imply a similar rate of change connecting these two disconnected ranges,
 during which there is no actual evidence that the sites actual elevation was
 anywhere near the linear regression line. which it is represented by in
 calculations for producing a GIA rate.\\
 In order to produce an estimate of GIA which better reflects the inconsistent
 coverage of the data over time, a better strategy would be to simply subtract
 the differences in elevation between sites and plot these differences with
 respect to time. Unfortunately however, none of the datasets have elevations
 sampled at the same times, an estimate of elevation being needed for times where
 one dataset
 has a data point present, but the other does not. In this paper, this estimate 
 (the modelled elevation) is created by using linear interpolation between datapoints,
 represented as a solid line between points as seen in Figure \ref{fig:rawDataWithModel}.\\
\input{rawDataWithModelGraph}
 \subsection{Methods}
 Once this estimate of elevation for times between sampled datapoints at a site
 is created, the difference in gia between sites can be created by subtracting
 the elevation of a measured data point from the modelled elevation of another
 dataset at that point in time, this difference is the dashed line shown in
 Figure \ref{fig:rawDataWithModelZoomed}:
 \begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=1.1\linewidth]{data/theDataZoomed.png}
	\caption{Example GIA comparison from a data point to a linear interpolation
	model, represented by an alternating dashed line}
	\label{fig:rawDataWithModelZoomed}
 \end{figure}
 To avoid making comparisons between data in one dataset and a model for another
 in areas where the model stretched over long distances between measured data
 (such as the 1500 year gap in TAHB), the data was grouped into a series of bins
 starting at 450 years before present with width of 200 years (ie the error bounds
 on the age values reported in the original data). If any bin had no data
 available for one site or the other in a comparison, none of the datapoints in
 that bin range were used to make comparisons, thus ensuring that areas like the
 gap in TAHB were avoided when making comparisons. In addition, a second rule
 that the counts for the bins needed to be within 75\% of one another was used,
 which cleared up a few areas where the datasets for both bins compared poorly,
 but produced valid comparison windows (see the small zone of GTB-TAHB overlap
 at \~ 600 years before present).
