\section{Introduction}
 The Earths crust rests on top of the mantle, its elevation rising and falling
 with the amount of mass weighing on it. During glacial periods, a significant portion
 of the water on earth is transferred in form from water in the oceans to glacial ice sheets,
 weighing down the continental crust and causing the mantle to dynamically adjust
 with it. This causes the crust to ride relatively lower in elevation,
 a change which reverses when the weight is removed as the ice sheets melt.
 This vertical motion of the crust while attempting to returning to its previous position is known
 as glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) (Scott et al, 2010).\\
 
 The process of GIA has implications for the routes that the flow
 of water on the Earths surface takes; the "tilting" of the surface caused by 
 uneven rates of GIA in different locations (the thickness and residence time of
 the ice sheet impacts how much the crust subsides and how rapidly it rebounds) 
 may open or close drainage outlets from basins,
 causing some rivers and lake outlets to go dry, while opening new outlets for 
 water to flow through as the 'tilt' of the lake basin changes and some locations
 rise and fall in elevation.
 Additionally, the change in "tilt" has potential to change shorelines of existing
 basins,  which has implications for land usage and long term engineering
 projections for structures such as locks and dams, where the lifetime of
 the structure may extend over decades or centuries. In the case of locks providing
 access to a canal, a local change in water level on the order of centimeters to
 meters over a century could cause the structure to become submerged below the
 rising water level, making the structure obsolete well within its intended usage
 lifetime.\\

 In order to project the future impact of this process on the Great Lakes Basin,
 an estimate of the historical rate of GIA is needed. This estimate is obtained by
 comparing the elevation of the water mark at two different locations around a basin, and
 observing how this difference changes over time. The elevation of the water can be inferred
 by a variety of indicators in the sediment record, in this case, beach deposits known
 as strandplain sequences are used, their ages determined by optically stimulated
 luminescence (OSL) dating. This raw data is presented in Figure \ref{fig:rawData}.\\

\newpage 
 
 The data used for this paper was previously published in
 Johnston et al, 2012, being sampled from four separate locations around
  Lake Superior:
 Au Train Bay, Michigan (known in this paper as ATB), Grand Traverse Bay,
 Michigan (GTB), Batchawana Bay, Ontario (BATB), and 
 Tahquamenon Bay, Michigan (TAHB).\\

	 the colour of each site marker will remain constant throughout the rest of
	 this paper for convenience). Reproduced with modifications from Johnston et al, 2012}
	\label{fig:johnstonLaurentianMapWithSites}
 \end{figure}

 
 Observing Figure \ref{fig:johnstonLaurentianMapWithSites}, it can be seen that
 all four datasets follow somewhat
 linear trends, decreasing in elevation as the time before present approaches the
 current day.
 This is because the crust underlying the LGL has been rebounding upwards
 over the past 5000 years, which can be interpreted to imply that areas that were at the
 elevation of the water surface in the past have been shifted upwards in elevation
 above the current water surface elevation. The rate of this upward trend varies
 by site, generally increasing for sites closest to the north and east extremes
 of the range studied.
 (this is due to the rate of rebound increasing with closeness to the center of
 the Laurentide Ice Sheet, roughly near current day James Bay in Northern Ontario).\\
 Between the four study sites, the most common feature is good data coverage between
 approximately 1000 and 3500 years before present, and a common gap in coverage around 2000
 years before present. This was due to conditions which worked against the
 formation of strandplain sequences during the Algoma lake level fluctuation
 (Johnston et al, 2014), thus causing most of our datasets to have interrupted
 records of lake level elevation at this time. While BATB has data
 coverage extending far beyond this range up to 5000 years before present, the others do not, which makes relative GIA
 comparisons impossible over that time range. The only dataset which does not follow
 this pattern of data coverage is TAHB, which will be discussed later in this section.\\ 
 In order to measure a relative rate of GIA between sites, the rate at which these
 trends diverge must be measured. In the previous work done on this dataset, this
 was accomplished by representing the trend of increasing elevation with age as
 a straight line using a linear regression over the age range of each lake phase (Johnston et al, 2012). This was an
 effective first approximation, but failed to take into account that the behaviour
 of each dataset may not necessarily have been truly linear over each lake phase, being affected by
 global water level changes caused by climate and other factors. \\
 In order to produce an estimate of GIA which better reflects the rate of GIA from
 comparisons made between elevations measured at similar times, a better strategy would be to simply subtract
 the differences in elevation between sites and plot these differences with
 respect to time, similar to the method used by Mainville \& Craymer (2005), using
 water gauge data. Unfortunately however, none of the datasets have elevations
 sampled at the same times, an estimate of elevation being needed for times where
 one dataset
 has a data point present, but the other does not. The goal of the research
 presented in this paper was to develop a new method of calculating direct differences
 in elevation between sites for the strandplain paleohydrographs published in
 Johnston et al (2012), and compare the results with rates for the process of GIA
 as calculated in prior studies concerning the LGL. \\

 \section{Methods}
 In this paper, the modelled elevation for points where elevation was not directly
 measured is created by using linear interpolation between datapoints,
 represented as a solid line between points as seen in Figure \ref{fig:rawDataWithModel}.
 Once this estimate of elevation for times between sampled datapoints at each site
 was created, the difference in GIA between sites were calculated by subtracting
 the elevation of a measured data point from the modelled elevation of another
 dataset at that point in time. This difference is shown as a dashed line in
 Figure \ref{fig:rawDataWithModelZoomed}:
 \begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=1.1\linewidth]{data/theDataZoomed.png}
	\caption{Example GIA comparison between strandplain datasets. Comparison made from a data point to the linear interpolation
	model, represented by a vertical alternating dashed line}
	\label{fig:rawDataWithModelZoomed}
 \end{figure}
 To avoid making comparisons between data in one dataset and a model for another
 in areas where the model stretched over long distances between measured data
 (such as the 1500 year gap in TAHB), the data for all four sites was grouped into a series of bins
 starting at 450 years before present with a width of 200 years for each bin.
 The start point was chosen by taking the youngest age value recorded in any of
 the datasets and rounding down to the nearest ten, in this case 450 years
 before present. The 200 year bin width was chosen as the error on the age models
 for shorelines published in Johnston et al (2012) had error bounds of approximately
 200 years.
 for the values reported in the age models published by Johnston et al (2012)). If any bin had no data
 available for one site or the other in a comparison, none of the datapoints in
 that bin range were used to make comparisons, thus ensuring that areas like the
 gap in TAHB were not included when making comparisons. In addition, a second rule
 was created, stipulating that the counts for the bins needed to be within 75\% of one another to be considered
 in calculating relative elevation between sites. This
 avoided a few areas where the datasets for both bins compared poorly,
 but produced valid comparison windows (On Figure \ref{fig:rawDataWithModel} see the small zone of GTB-TAHB overlap
 at \~ 600 years before present).\\
 In order to implement the methods described above, a python script was used to
 process the data provided by Professor Johnston from his 2012 paper. The source
 code used can be seen in the appendix of this paper.
 
 Using comparisons from measured data points to linear interpolation model for
 pairs of study sites,
 two graphs of the relative difference over time was created for each pair
 of sites. For example, for
 the site combination of ATB \& BATB, ATB was first compared to BATB, followed 
 by a comparison from BATB to ATB. The rates of GIA produced by these comparisons
 should be of opposite signs, but similar magnitudes.
 
 The GIA rates are determined by applying a linear regression to each comparison,
 the slope of each regression representing the relative rate of GIA between sites.
