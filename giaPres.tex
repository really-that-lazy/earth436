\section{Method}
-OSL dating used to determine age for sequences of late Holocene shoreline
deposits, (known as Strandplain sequences) at each site vs current day elevation.\\
-Not all strandplains were age dated due to cost, so a linear regression model of age vs horizontal distance along the strandplain sequence is used to estimate age values for strandplains that were not directly age dated.\\
-This is then used to create a graph of elevation vs time for each site\\
\newpage
\section[2]{Method}
-OSL dating used to determine age for sequences of Quaternary beach deposits (strandplain sequences) at each site vs current day elevation.\\
-This is then used to create a graph of elevation vs time for each site\\
% talk about location
% talk about link between importance of water levels and they cant be understood
% without understanding gia
% talk about what gia is
\include{rawDataGraph}
% talk about structure of data, what are axes, why is it increasing
% talk about objective
\newpage
\section[2]{Method}
-Data not available continuously for each site, or at the same time for each site to compare gia, so values must be inferred using linear interpolation between known data points.\\
\include{rawDataWithModelGraph}
% note mainville & craymer, previous work has used water level gauge data, but
% cant infer a long term process from short term data
\newpage
\section[2]{Method}
-GIA is now plotted by subtracting between the measured values of one dataset and the modelled value of another.\\
-6 combinations of pairs of sites are created, each of which has a forward (A to B) and backward (B to A) comparison.\\
